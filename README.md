### üì¶ Introducing react-next-toast üçû
Tired of dealing with complex notification packages or having to spend time building components just to render alerts or toast notificaitons in your React projects? Look no further! Here, I introduce `react-next-toast` 

### üöÄ Why Choose react-next-toast??
- Easy to use: `react-next-toast` was built with ease in mind - say goodbye to complex toast declarations - with react-next-toast you have a toast via a single function call.
- Customizable: With our 4 different types of Toast Notifications - Success, Error, Warning and Info, you get a fine-tuned and different UI display for each which directly passes message from the choice of colour and design. It also provides option to choose duration of toasts, colours and fonts.
- Lightweight: Designed with performance in mind as well, the package is designed to lightweight in other to ensure it does not slow down your app's performance.
- Fully-typed: `react-next-toast` comes with TypeScript support out of the box to provide type safety and seamless renderings.

### üìù How to Use:
1. Install the package into your project
   
~~~
npm install react-next-toast
~~~

2. Import the `showToast` & use in your Component:

```javascript
import { showToast } from 'react-next-toast';

const MyComponent = () => {

const handleClick = () => {
    showToast.success('Log in successful')
}

return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello Dev</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Log in</button>
    </div>
);
}
export default MyComponent;

````
### üí° Additional Features
You can customize the `duration` of the Toast Notification by passing time in `ms` as second parameter to the `showToast` function.
The default is `5000` which is 5 seconds.

````javascript
const handleClick = () => {
  showToast.error('incorrect login details', 4000)
}
````

#### **NOTE:** _For more advanced customization, you can directly use the ToastNotification component and pass in the required props - duration, position, className._
